# Professional Portfolio

This project serves as the base code for my professional portfolio. The portfolio showcases my work experience, projects, and skills in the realm of software development. It is developed using Python and Streamlit.

## Structure

- `main.py`: Main Streamlit application file.
- `environment.yaml`: Contains all the Python dependencies needed by the project managed by a Conda environment.
- `assets/`: Directory that contains all images and other static files used in the project.

## Environment

This project was developed using Python and Streamlit, along with a Conda environment. Follow the steps below to set up your development environment:

1. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to manage the Python environment.
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/portfolio.git`.
3. Navigate to the project folder: `cd portfolio`.
4. Create a new Conda environment using 'environment.yaml' file: `conda create --name portfolio_env --file environment.yaml`.
5. Activate the new environment: `conda activate portfolio_env`.

## Usage

To start the Streamlit development server, run `streamlit run main.py`. This will start the server and the portfolio should be available at `http://localhost:8501`.
